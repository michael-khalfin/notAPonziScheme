Each file is named as follows: *<FileType>_<EndPeriod>_<StartPeriod>*

_FileType_ is either "expected_return" or "covariance_matrix"

_EndPeriod_ indicates the last period of data that is considered in building the covariance matrix. That is, for _EndPeriod_ = n, we consider the period n data in estimation

_StartPeriod_ indicates the first period of data that is considered when building the covariance matrix.
